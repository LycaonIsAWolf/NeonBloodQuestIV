This is a game I made with my friend [Deirdre](https://twitter.com/cosmicwangst) for [Ludum Dare 36](http://ludumdare.com/compo/). You can download the finished product [here](https://lycaon.itch.io/neon-blood-quest-iv).

This repository contains all the code I made for this project, and its open-source dependencies. Those are:

* [KinoGlitch](https://github.com/keijiro/KinoGlitch)
* [Pixeltron](https://www.patreon.com/posts/image-effect-v1-4149396)
* [YarnSpinner](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner)

It does *not* include the prefabs or models/textures, so you won't be able to download this and open it in Unity and have it work. The game is free, though, so there's that.
